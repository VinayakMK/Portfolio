            So basically I am new to this field. As a 22 year old computer engineering student, 
            who graduated in the year of 2022, I am looking to work as a beginner level UI/UX designer
            in any company, because this is the field I mostly like. So I started learning about 
            UI/UX designing like a year ago. I am still on way to learn full stack develoment.

            Other than this, I game a lot and also a big fan of sports especially football. 
            I wish I could travel alot.
            So yeah that's me...
